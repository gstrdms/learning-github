# learning-github
This is my first experience with GitHub and is a modified version of their tutorial.
I'm just a few months into my coding education, having completed the freecodecamp.org Responsive Web Development certification and currently in the process of completing the JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures certification. More recently I learned about the importance of GitHub and Git in version control so I'm making an effort to try to gain some experience with this platform to demystify it.
